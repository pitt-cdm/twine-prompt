# INSTRUCTIONS
Guiding questions are below; add your answers in the appropriate sections, and feel free to add new sections in addition.



## The team
Who is working on this project?








## The pitch
What's the basic pitch for the Twine narrative? Where do you start? Who do you play as? What's the genre?







## The strategy
### ... overall
What overall mode of collaboration are you planning to use: divide the work by project sections? by media types and expertise? by compromise and consensus all the way through? (See _Writer/Designer_ pages 113-114.)



### ... in particular
Now add some specificity to that general plan: who will take what role, at what points? How will you communicate with each other?

IMPORTANT: never include personal info like phone numbers on GitHub! But please do make sure you know how to reach each other, okay?

## The rest
Feel free to add any further thoughts, plans, or possibilities... or to answer additional questions from the Group Contract on page 116 of Writer/Designer.
